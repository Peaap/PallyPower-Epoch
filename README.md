PallyPower-Epoch is a modernized Ace3 rewrite of the classic PallyPower addon—streamlined for Epoch. It provides fast, reliable Paladin blessing assignment, smart auto-
  assign, and easy per-player overrides with a clean AceGUI interface. Salvation support is fully integrated, and the codebase is lean, Ace3-only, and ready for raid use.
