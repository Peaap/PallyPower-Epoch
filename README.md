PallyPower-Epoch is a modernized Ace3 rewrite of the classic PallyPower addon—streamlined for Epoch. It provides fast, reliable Paladin blessing assignment, smart auto-
  assign, and easy per-player overrides with a clean AceGUI interface. Salvation support is fully integrated, and the codebase is lean, Ace3-only, and ready for raid use.

  Description
  PallyPower-Epoch helps Paladins coordinate and maintain raid-wide blessings with minimal clicks. It delivers the familiar PallyPower experience with a modern core,
  improved UI, and a few quality-of-life upgrades tailored for Epoch.

  - Ace3 migration: Uses AceAddon-3.0, AceDB-3.0, AceConfig-3.0, and AceGUI-3.0. No Ace2 or Dewdrop dependencies.
  - Easy assignments: Class grid for greater blessings, plus an AceGUI dialog for per-player normal blessings.
  - Auto-assign: Distributes blessings to classes based on paladin ranks/talents and smart templates.
  - Salvation support: Includes Blessing and Greater Blessing of Salvation with sensible smart rules.
  - Smart buffs: Skips suboptimal buffs for certain classes (configurable).
  - Profiles: AceDB-3.0 profile management; scales and layout are customizable.
  - Clean UI controls: Toggle class/player buttons, alignments, rows/columns, gapping, and skins.
  - Embedded libraries: Ships with Ace3—no external installs required.
